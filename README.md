# SPI Test

Testing https://www.baeldung.com/java-spi

## Getting Started

Run the main in `Application` of project `app`.

It will discover implementations of `Crystal` interface defined in classpath.

Play with the classpath to see that it will impact the result. If you remove
`crystal_local` or `crystal_ras` then it will remove the corresponding implementations
from the results !
